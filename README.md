1. creating a "Pull requeest"

How to Create a Pull Request on GitHub

After both Tom and Jerry have pushed their work to their respective branches, the next step is to create a pull request for each of them. Hereâ€™s how Tom would create a pull request for his changes:

1. Navigate to YOUR GitHub Repository:

   - Open your web browser and go to the GitHub page for the repository.

2. Switch to the Branch:

   - Click the branch dropdown menu near the top left corner of the file list and select the branch Tom have been working on, in this case, update-navigation branch.

   - Now we review Tom work and pull the request

   * Reviewing and merging pull requests. It become visible  how team members Tom and Jerry manage their contributions to a project. Tom creates a pull request from his update-navigation branch, making his changes visible to the team for review. Other team members can then provide feedback, leave comments, and request modifications
